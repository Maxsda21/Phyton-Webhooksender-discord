Install Python: If you don't already have Python installed on your system, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. Make sure to select the appropriate version of Python for your system (Python 3 is recommended), and make a note of the location where Python is installed on your system.

Install pip: Pip is the package manager for Python, and is used to install third-party libraries like requests. To install pip, open a command prompt or terminal and enter the following command:


python get-pip.py
This will download and install pip on your system.

Install requests: Once you have pip installed, you can use it to install the requests library by entering the following command:


pip install requests
This will download and install the requests library and all its dependencies on your system.

Download the Discord Webhook GUI script: You can download the script from the GitHub repository where it is hosted (https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY). Click the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" to download a zip file containing the script and all its dependencies.

Extract the zip file: Once the zip file has downloaded, extract it to a convenient location on your system, such as your desktop or Downloads folder.

Open a command prompt or terminal: To run the script, you will need to open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is located. You can do this by opening the command prompt or terminal and using the cd command to change to the appropriate directory.

Launch the script: Once you are in the directory where the script is located, you can launch it by entering the following command:


python discord_webhook_gui.py

This will launch the script and open the Discord Webhook GUI window. You can enter your Discord webhook URL in the first window, and then enter your message and click the "Send" button in the second window to send a message to the specified webhook.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to use the Discord Webhook GUI script even if you don't have Python or requests installed on your system.
